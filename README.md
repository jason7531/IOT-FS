KAPA Sports Online Mart Web App
The web app currently is under development, its functional but needs some moere features, which i am working on like Cancellation of orders within 24hours using moment.js, adding user reviews and manymore features, the web app has also been deployed in heroku but it needs a little bit of debugging right now.
The web app is connected to the Mongo Db Atlas and is working fine on local machines, followed the REST API convention.
You cant add products to others inventory, first sign up then create inventory, then click info button of the product you want to purchase and add the product to inventory of your name.
you can view your orders by clicking your inventory.
